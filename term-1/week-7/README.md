## Use cases - what it's good for.

![Image](board.jpg)

- Bluetooth Low Energy and native USB support
- 'All-in-one' Arduino-compatible + Bluetooth Low Energy with built in USB plus battery charging
- Arduino IDE support
- Cortex-M4 processor
- nRF52832 projects downward compatible
- Pre-programed the chip with our UF2 bootloader

## Hookup and Pins

### Power Pins

![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/006y8mN6gy1g92gbcd57cj31400u0hdu.jpg)

- **3V**: used to supply 3.3V power to external sensors, breakouts or Feather Wings
- **LIPO Input** (Bat): Voltage supply from the optional rechargeable cell. Can be connected via JST PH connector.
- **VREG Enable** (En): Can be set to GND to disable the 3.3V output. By default set to HIGH.
- **USB Power** (USB): Supplies voltage from USB (4.5-5.2V)

### Analog Inputs

![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/006y8mN6gy1g92gbb6kw8j31400u0hdu.jpg)

- 6 analog pins (A0–A5)
- 2 ADC pins (AREF, VIVD)

**AREF** (A7): optional external analog reference.  
**VIDV** (A6): allows measurement of battery charge. Can be used as an output.

### PWM Output

Any GPIO pin can be configured as PWM.

### I2C Pins

- Require external pullup resistors to function. Not present by default
- All Adafruit breakouts normally have pullups, hence this likely won't be an issue

### User Switches

- A general purpose switch is accessible via D7
- On board reset, press this button to force USB bootloader mode

### SWD Connector

- Long header at center board
- For advanced debugging or to reprogram the board using a 1.27mm SWD cable

### LEDs

![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/006y8mN6gy1g92gba1wbtj31400u0u0x.jpg)

There are 3 basic LEDs on the board

1. **D3**: general red LED. Can be used for any desired purpose. Used as a status indicator.
2. **CONN**: blue LED. Indicates connection status for bluetooth
3. **CHG**: indicates a charging battery if connected to a USB power supply

The feather has an integrated RGB light called the **RGB Neo Pixel**. It's color can be configured via code as PIN_NEOPIXEL. It is a good way to test if the board is setup correctly.

```c++
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
}
```

## SDK

### Drivers

To install the drivers, you know where to go by now.

### API

[ Arduino Bluefruit nRF52 API reference ](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-nrf52-feather-learning-guide/bluefruit-nrf52-api)
The API is class-based, with the following classes being most commonly used (from Adafruit's documentation):

- [ AdafruitBluefruit ](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-nrf52-feather-learning-guide/adafruitbluefruit) - the essential most-used class
- [ BLEService ](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-nrf52-feather-learning-guide/bleservice) - wrapper class for [ BLE GATT ](https://learn.adafruit.com/introduction-to-bluetooth-low-energy/gatt) custom services.
- [ BLECharacteristic ](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-nrf52-feather-learning-guide/blecharacteristic) - wrapper class for [ BLE GATT ](https://learn.adafruit.com/introduction-to-bluetooth-low-energy/gatt) custom characteristics.
- [ BLEDis ](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-nrf52-feather-learning-guide/bledis) - helper for Device Information Services.
- [ BLEUart ](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-nrf52-feather-learning-guide/bleuart) - helper for [ Nordic UART Service ](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.nordic.infocenter.sdk5.v15.2.0%2Fgroup__ble__nus.html)
- [ BLEBeacon ](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-nrf52-feather-learning-guide/blebeacon) - helper class to use the device as a Bluetooth beacon using the BT advertising packet.
- [ BLEMidi ](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-nrf52-feather-learning-guide/blemidi) - helper class to use MIDI data (audio, etc) over Bluetooth.
- [ BLEHidAdafruit ](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-nrf52-feather-learning-guide/blehidadafruit) - is a helper class to emulate an HID mouse or keyboard over BLE. [ Related project ](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-essentials/circuitpython-hid-keyboard-and-mouse)

### Languages

- C++ (the default)
- [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/)

### IDEs

The Feather supports the usage of the Arduino IDE, but the IDE doesn't include the support out of the box. To install:

1. Download and install the Arduino IDE (At least v1.6.12)
2. Start the Arduino IDE
3. Go into Preferences
4. Add https://www.adafruit.com/package_adafruit_index.json as an 'Additional Board Manager URL'
5. Restart the Arduino IDE
6. Open the Boards Manager from the Tools -> Board menu and install 'Adafruit nRF52 by Adafruit'
7. Once the BSP is installed, select 'Adafruit Bluefruit nRF52 Feather' from the Tools -> Board menu, which will update your system config to use the right compiler and settings for the nRF52.
8. Write, compile, upload over USB.

##### Adafruit Sponsored Libraries and Drivers from CircuitPython

https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/docs/drivers.rst

#### Bluefruit App

##### Using your iOS or Android phone/tablet as a controller

A USB bootloader lets you quickly use it with the Arduino IDE or to install CircuitPython.

###### Sent data Format

Each Controller data packet sent is prefixed with single byte char “!” (0x21) followed by a single byte char initial for identification.
Sensor data values are encoded as floats of 4 byte length.  
Each packet ends with a single byte checksum for validation.
