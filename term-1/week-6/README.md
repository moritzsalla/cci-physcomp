### Lab

Quite confusing this. Works well sometimes, and on other occasions it won't work at all and I can't figure out why. Getting the scematic right is quite challenging with this amount of pins. Had it live when I assembled it and it suddenly started reacting to the proximity of my finger. Late realized that my laptop was plugged into the mains—this is what caused it.
