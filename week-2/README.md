# Week 2 Practical

1. LEDs in serial & parallel
- How many leds can you hook up with a 220k resistor in serial before running out of voltage?
- How many leds can you hook up with a 220k resistor in parallel before running out of voltage?
2. Serial Data
- Using the hello sketch, play with the serial monitor( In the Arduino menu Tools>Serial Monitor) to tell a wee story based on player input. It can be around 3 lines long.
3. Potentiometers
- Hook up a knob and have it change the brightness of an LED
4. Light Dependent Resistors
- Hook up an LDR. Try making the LED change brightness depending on the light level.
5. Playing with Common Sensors
→ __Collab with Harry, we had the PIRS motion sensor__
