# Week 4 Practical

1. Project proposal
For next week make sure you fill out the final project proposal form

2. Hook up a servo.
Hook up a servo and make it move using pwm. Do this tutorial

3. Hook up a motor
Using the circuit from the Arduino project book, do project 9. Feel free to get creative with the pinwheel bit of you want.

4. Hook up an MPR121
Create a circuit you control with a touch sensor.
Do this tutorial

5. The Capsense library
Give a go with this tutorial What are some creative ideas you could do with this? Try one out and submit it as this lab.

### Capsense Setup

Can sense the proximity of your finger to the copper sheet. Putting a sheet of paper in between finger and the copper will seemingly yield slightly more consistent results, almost like its smoothing it out.

### Having fun with Capsense

This script visualizes how hard you press the copper sheet by toggling different LEDs at different input levels. If you hover your finger just where the clips touch the copper, the leds start to flicker rapidly.
