# Week 4 Practical

1. Project proposal
For next week make sure you fill out the final project proposal form

2. Hook up a servo.
Hook up a servo and make it move using pwm. Do this tutorial

3. Hook up a motor
Using the circuit from the Arduino project book, do project 9. Feel free to get creative with the pinwheel bit of you want.

4. Hook up an MPR121
Create a circuit you control with a touch sensor.
Do this tutorial

5. The Capsense library
Give a go with this tutorial What are some creative ideas you could do with this? Try one out and submit it as this lab.

### The Capsense library

Can sense the proximity of your finger to the copper sheet. Putting a sheet of paper in between finger and the copper will seemingly yield slightly more consistent results, almost like its smoothing it out.
