# Simple Simon Says Game

Brief: Get playful with buttons and LEDS. Make a simple timing game such as Simon Says with at least 3 levels and a clear start and end. Have 3 buttons for interaction and make it so you press the first botton to start the game. When the game is
over, all 3 LEDS should come on and stay in until the start button is pressed again. If you have an idea for a better game, give it a go. I'm open to you editing these briefs. This is graduate school, have fun.
